== Spring Cloud CLI
Start Spring Cloud Eureka with Spring Cloud CLI.

```bash
 spring cloud eureka
```

== Run Spring Boot Applications

There are two Spring profiles so you can run the application twice without any port conflicts and random port problems
Spring profile _srv1_ with port _8081_ and _srv2_ with port _8082_ 

```bash

Members {size:2, ver:2} [
	Member [192.168.1.103]:5701 - b7a4b001-90b6-44dd-9b1a-eca1603096f2
	Member [192.168.1.103]:5702 - 97b69ae5-7155-4b4c-8d20-b10cb3693b89 this
]

```
You can hit the API like (this will generate a new UUID) for _foo_

[source,bash]
----
http :8081/api/foo
----

now you can hit the 2nd API (server instance) and we expect the same result
```bash
http :8082/api/foo
```
